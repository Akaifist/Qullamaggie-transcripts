## 🎯 Key Highlights

### [00:00 - 12:13] Highlight 1

Okay, this is the watchlist for the week of January 20th 3 January 23th First off is MYHI It's a Weedstock The whole group has been strong and bigger Runs past couple of months and I think this is About to Fall Hopefully they will have another day or two Will goes up. I would love to see this thing go to a buck But if it doesn't I'll be ready I'm basically looking for this thing to open up green Let's look at the intraday short This is the 60 minute short Basically maybe push to this high high 60s slow 70s send area and Fade off from there And if it takes up the highs I'll just stop out and hope for that one plus move Next up is ESSI also I think is also Weedstock to pay pump Um it's the same thing basically I'm looking for Certainly on five push or higher I'd love to see this thing go to 556 bucks next few days, but I think Monday I'll start shorting it Maybe if it goes green to red or some kind of lower highs or some kind of weakness And again just watching it right now or I'm stalking it There's nothing here. I'm gonna put it in the watch list CNX I tried it on friday lost about 2500 bucks didn't really crack like I wanted to Hopefully this thing pushes to 14 plus Again looking for some kind of weakness to short it Shaynog I was swing short it here I covered some I thought this thing would break down to sub seven It didn't stop me out here in the high 80s and I'm looking to get back in and it had a big run from These lows who are 100% and I'm basically looking to short here in high eights And you use this low nine areas my stop. I think this thing fades back to sub seven Uh, if it doesn't I'll just take a loss on it P nap I was short on friday Shorted it here in the open Covered most down here low two some me twos. I kept some you know, I did not think this thing would bounce back this much I was actually kind of surprised. I did not think this thing would see three bucks again, but it did And it's actually good because good look even another opportunity short it on Monday Again, you know, it goes green the red Or some kind of weakness Okay, this was my short watch list. Let's look at the longs GSD I'm not super excited about it, but last time it had a breakout here Had a big move About 32% pretty good breakout Um, you know, it's not I'm not super excited about it Um VLX Also one I'm watching no super excited about it. I'm following on movies to another watch list These are not very actionable yet. I'm basically looking for a big Green candle With high volume I did trade it from here To here I stopped out my last shares here So I had a pretty decent trade about 20 About 18% on about half of my shares and then I stopped stopped out on half Evbg Recent IPO these things can move Looking for somewhere breakout or 19 low 19th area low 19th area with volume Momo Again looking for breakout not super excited about it. Hopefully go sideways for another three to five days PGMX Um Golf recent IPO O-Rex had a Nicely run Now being going sideways. Hopefully it can go sideways a few more days So this 20 day moving ever can catch off to the price And you know this thing could break if it breaks out could break out good of 455 Very explosive kind of a stock you know beaten down Small gap bioxambeen hoped As few months CRK or gas sector also usually beaten down stock. Let's look at the weekly chart You know this thing was a hundred and forty nine dollar stock just two years ago and Yeah, I think good move, you know just a year ago this thing was a twenty dollar stock So you know it's already had a nice move 200% from the lows in August or May whatever you want to call it and It's nice and tight just you know riding on this moving average is resting You know volume is low looks very good. I think this thing has a range expansion of volume this thing can make it being moved You'd have made something was 25% 25% this thing going to easily do 20 30% move Excel. I'm looking at it. I don't necessarily think it's ready at this getting tight now But again, I think the 20 and 50 need to catch off a little bit preferably another 3 to 5 days Sideways would be ideal D and R it is ready. I just need a ring needs a range expansion very nice tight flag Looks very very good and it's liquid very liquid. You can very easily do 30 50 you know even 100 000 shares on this thing I probably won't do more than 30 maybe 40 Uh, and maybe use up like a tens and stoppers up like that. We'll see WTI and other oil and gas It is a little bit extended. I'm not super excited about it. I did trade it here On this break out here I had a pretty decent trade. It's all done way up then I got stopped out on some when it Started fading back um I'm looking at it just in case and CVT Recent IPO looks good just resting on a 50 day 20 day 10 day everything is getting very tight here Good haven't underlink not very excited about it since it's already had a few runs you know run here Run here around here But you know if you can tighten up another couple of days and then break out I can't just ignore it X very good looking getting tight on the 50 day had a big run The sector has been hot steel sector Still has been weak for years and years Here we've had a big pull run Do do mostly do the shine up And now now the demand may come from the US with a trunk being for structure Uh Investment and things like that GTLS looks good It's looking flat short a little bit thin but The 50 day can catch shop a few more days would be great if I Yeah, looks good relatively recent IPO Again, I think 50 day needs to get shop a little bit more K and S sell another recent IPO looks good ATW Had a big run Again, it is only gas names they will break out at the same time You know if it's gonna break out, it's probably gonna break out With all the other oil gas names and I have a few more here's another one Here's another one Sino Actually, I'm gonna remove it from my watches. I'm gonna set an alert here Uh So one of these days he wants to go another run I'll be alert Looks good had a big run A couple months ago and He may have just slowed break down, you know, these shippers they were up on They're all new near bankruptcy and Not really gas, these bags and other shipper ran on nothing just pure momentum But they can run again. I traded it Here on the long side. I did traded short here and here And other shipper Just in case them sector gets hot. It's good to have these stickers in head You see one starting to run there or gonna just good chance to go around Uh, this one had a big run getting tight Not really yet necessarily. I think I think not just set an alert For it time she and looks good at seeking out particles started this run ran up like 60% I was being going sideways hopefully the 20 day Would cash up in next few days and then going on the run mankind. This is almost definite bankruptcy Next within a year or so I think But this thing, you know, has been unknown almost definite bankruptcy for a while doesn't mean it can't run You know hear it went out 200% here it went up Yeah, I'm gonna do this. I can't see the shark too much takes my main monitor Uh, it's much bigger. It's a 34 a 32 inch monitor Uh, there's much more space between This takes boxes But this is just a 14 inch monitor. There's no room Let's see 100% run here, you know, this has been this has been unknown bankruptcy for years and years and this thing can't have big runs Just gotta be careful with size in case to do something bad overnight I'm chian wasn't this on this list? Oh Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going wrong one VKTX. Oh, okay, doesn't look as good on this monitor My other one apri just looking at a recent momentum stock Maybe there would be a trade-off long short. I don't know. Paul's saying ETRM mainly on Short watch. Shuffle this thing and push over 10 bucks again and I'll be looking for weakness TBIO Sentin they all run together, you know if what you know ETRM is the leaders if ETM runs You know as you can see TBIO runs APR irons pull them around PRBS Sure bias in this one Okay, that's it You

**[00:00]** Okay, this is the watchlist for the week of January 20th

**[00:10]** 3 January 23th

**[00:13]** First off is MYHI

**[00:18]** It's a

**[00:19]** Weedstock

**[00:21]** The whole group has been strong and bigger

**[00:23]** Runs past couple of months and I think this is

**[00:28]** About to

**[00:31]** Fall

**[00:32]** Hopefully they will have another day or two

**[00:36]** Will goes up. I would love to see this thing go to a buck

**[00:39]** But if it doesn't I'll be ready

**[00:42]** I'm basically looking for this thing to open up green

**[00:46]** Let's look at the intraday short

**[00:48]** This is the 60 minute short

**[00:51]** Basically maybe push to this high high 60s slow 70s send area and

**[00:57]** Fade off from there

**[01:01]** And if it takes up the highs I'll just stop out and hope for that one plus move

**[01:11]** Next up is ESSI also I think is also

**[01:16]** Weedstock to pay pump

**[01:20]** Um it's the same thing basically I'm looking for

**[01:23]** Certainly on five push or higher

**[01:27]** I'd love to see this thing go to

**[01:30]** 556 bucks next few days, but I think Monday

**[01:35]** I'll start shorting it

**[01:38]** Maybe if it goes green to red or some kind of lower highs or some kind of weakness

**[01:48]** And again just watching it right now or I'm stalking it

**[01:52]** There's nothing here. I'm gonna put it in the watch list

**[01:58]** CNX I tried it on friday lost about 2500 bucks didn't really crack like I wanted to

**[02:04]** Hopefully this thing pushes to 14 plus

**[02:07]** Again looking for some kind of weakness to short it

**[02:12]** Shaynog I was swing short it here

**[02:17]** I covered some I thought this thing would break down to sub seven

**[02:22]** It didn't stop me out here in the high 80s and

**[02:27]** I'm looking to get back in and it had a big run from

**[02:31]** These lows who are 100% and I'm basically looking to short here in high eights

**[02:39]** And you use this low nine areas my stop. I think this thing fades back to sub seven

**[02:45]** Uh, if it doesn't I'll just take a loss on it

**[02:49]** P nap I was short on friday

**[02:53]** Shorted it here

**[02:54]** in the open

**[02:56]** Covered most down here low two some me twos. I kept some you know, I did not think this thing would bounce back this much

**[03:04]** I was actually kind of surprised. I did not think this thing would see three bucks again, but it did

**[03:09]** And it's actually good because good look even another opportunity short it on Monday

**[03:16]** Again, you know, it goes green the red

**[03:22]** Or some kind of weakness

**[03:25]** Okay, this was my short watch list. Let's look at the longs GSD

**[03:32]** I'm not super excited about it, but last time it had a breakout here

**[03:38]** Had a big move

**[03:41]** About 32% pretty good breakout

**[03:44]** Um, you know, it's not I'm not super excited about it

**[03:51]** VLX

**[03:53]** Also one I'm watching no super excited about it. I'm following on movies to another watch list

**[03:58]** These are not very actionable yet. I'm basically looking for a big

**[04:04]** Green candle

**[04:06]** With high volume

**[04:08]** I did trade it from here

**[04:10]** To here I stopped out my last shares here

**[04:14]** So I had a pretty decent trade about 20

**[04:17]** About 18% on about half of my shares and then I stopped stopped out on half

**[04:23]** Evbg

**[04:46]** Golf

**[04:47]** recent IPO

**[04:50]** O-Rex had a

**[04:53]** Nicely run

**[04:55]** Now being going sideways. Hopefully it can go sideways a few more days

**[04:59]** So this 20 day moving ever can catch off to the price

**[05:03]** And you know this thing could break if it breaks out could break out good of 455

**[05:08]** Very explosive kind of a stock you know beaten down

**[05:12]** Small gap bioxambeen hoped

**[05:15]** As few months CRK or gas sector also usually beaten down stock. Let's look at the weekly chart

**[05:22]** You know this thing was a hundred and forty nine dollar stock just two years ago

**[05:30]** and

**[05:32]** Yeah, I think good move, you know just a year ago this thing was a twenty dollar stock

**[05:37]** So you know it's already had a nice move

**[05:40]** 200% from the lows in August or May whatever you want to call it and

**[05:48]** It's nice and tight just you know riding on this moving average is resting

**[05:52]** You know volume is low looks very good. I think this thing has a range expansion of volume this thing can make it being moved

**[06:00]** You'd have made something was 25%

**[06:04]** 25% this thing going to easily do 20 30% move

**[06:10]** Excel. I'm looking at it. I don't necessarily think it's ready at this getting tight now

**[06:16]** But again, I think the 20 and 50 need to catch off a little bit preferably another

**[06:22]** 3 to 5 days

**[06:25]** Sideways would be ideal

**[06:27]** D and R it is ready. I just need a ring needs a range expansion very nice tight flag

**[06:35]** Looks very very good and it's liquid very liquid. You can very easily do 30 50 you know even 100 000 shares on this thing

**[06:43]** I probably won't do more than 30 maybe 40

**[06:48]** Uh, and maybe use up like a tens and stoppers up like that. We'll see WTI and other oil and gas

**[06:54]** It is a little bit extended. I'm not super excited about it. I did trade it here

**[07:00]** On this break out here

**[07:02]** I had a pretty decent trade. It's all done way up then I got stopped out on some when it

**[07:08]** Started fading back

**[07:10]** um

**[07:12]** I'm looking at it just in case and CVT

**[07:17]** Recent IPO looks good just resting on a 50 day 20 day

**[07:22]** 10 day everything is getting very tight here

**[07:26]** Good haven't underlink not very excited about it since it's already had a few runs you know run here

**[07:32]** Run here around here

**[07:34]** But you know if you can tighten up another couple of days and then break out I can't just ignore it

**[07:41]** X very good looking getting tight on the 50 day had a big run

**[07:46]** The sector has been hot steel sector

**[07:49]** Still has been weak for years and years

**[07:53]** Here we've had a big pull run

**[07:56]** Do do mostly do the shine up

**[07:59]** And now now the demand may come from the US with a trunk being for structure

**[08:06]** Uh

**[08:07]** Investment and things like that

**[08:10]** GTLS looks good

**[08:13]** It's looking flat short a little bit thin

**[08:16]** but

**[08:19]** The 50 day can catch shop a few more days would be great if I

**[08:24]** Yeah, looks good relatively recent IPO

**[08:29]** Again, I think 50 day needs to get shop a little bit more K and S sell another recent IPO looks good

**[08:34]** ATW

**[08:37]** Had a big run

**[08:39]** Again, it is only gas names they will break out at the same time

**[08:43]** You know if it's gonna break out, it's probably gonna break out

**[08:46]** With all the other oil gas names and I have a few more here's another one

**[08:51]** Here's another one

**[08:53]** Sino

**[08:55]** Actually, I'm gonna remove it from my watches. I'm gonna set an alert here

**[08:59]** Uh

**[09:01]** So one of these days he wants to go another run

**[09:04]** I'll be alert

**[09:06]** Looks good had a big run

**[09:09]** A couple months ago and

**[09:11]** He may have just slowed break down, you know, these shippers they were up on

**[09:15]** They're all new near bankruptcy and

**[09:20]** Not really gas, these bags and other shipper

**[09:23]** ran on nothing just pure momentum

**[09:26]** But they can run again. I traded it

**[09:30]** Here on the long side. I did traded short here and here

**[09:33]** And other shipper

**[09:40]** Just in case them sector gets hot. It's good to have these stickers in head

**[09:45]** You see one starting to run there or gonna just good chance to go around

**[09:49]** Uh, this one had a big run getting tight

**[09:53]** Not really yet necessarily. I think I think not just set an alert

**[09:57]** For it time she and looks good at seeking out particles started this run

**[10:05]** ran up like 60% I was being going sideways hopefully the 20 day

**[10:10]** Would cash up in next few days and then going on the run mankind. This is

**[10:15]** almost definite bankruptcy

**[10:18]** Next within a year or so I think

**[10:22]** But this thing, you know, has been unknown almost definite bankruptcy for a while doesn't mean it can't run

**[10:29]** You know hear it went out 200% here it went up

**[10:35]** Yeah, I'm gonna do this. I can't see the shark too much takes my main monitor

**[10:41]** Uh, it's much bigger. It's a 34 a 32 inch monitor

**[10:47]** Uh, there's much more space between

**[10:49]** This takes boxes

**[10:53]** But this is just a 14 inch monitor. There's no room

**[10:56]** Let's see

**[10:58]** 100% run here, you know, this has been this has been unknown bankruptcy for years and years and this thing can't have big runs

**[11:06]** Just gotta be careful with size in case to do something bad overnight

**[11:12]** I'm chian wasn't this on this list? Oh

**[11:16]** Oh, I'm sorry. I'm going wrong one

**[11:19]** VKTX. Oh, okay, doesn't look as good on this monitor

**[11:27]** My other one apri just looking at a recent momentum stock

**[11:32]** Maybe there would be a trade-off long short. I don't know. Paul's saying ETRM

**[11:38]** mainly on

**[11:41]** Short watch. Shuffle this thing and push over 10 bucks again and I'll be looking for weakness TBIO

**[11:47]** Sentin they all run together, you know if what you know ETRM is the leaders if ETM runs

**[11:53]** You know as you can see TBIO runs

**[11:55]** APR irons pull them around

**[11:58]** PRBS

**[12:01]** Sure bias in this one

**[12:04]** Okay, that's it

**[12:10]** You
