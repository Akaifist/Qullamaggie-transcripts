## 🎯 Key Highlights

### [00:00 - 02:30] Highlight 1

three parts. The first part will be yesterday's trading recap. Then I'll do the watchlist for today and then I'll go through my tracking watchlist and overall market action. So, let's see what did I trade yesterday. DCTH bought it down here. I saw some huge volume coming in. I bought it at 35 cents. It popped a little bit on volume than I was sitting on it. Baded 35 got filled. Only the 25,000 small shares. I haven't really sold any shares yet. I think about selling half at the open and then keep half in case you want to go to a buck or something. USC, this the whole group broke out today. I did this here. The opening range high spot. I got stopped out. I think I lost like 1500 on it. Then I got back in a little bit more size. Hopefully this thing and probably have followed it. Two bucks or something that would be nice. CNX I lost. Actually I had the PNL here. So, you can see USC, I took a, yeah, 1300 bucks. Lost and now I have 30, 3100 on realized to far on it. CNX I locked in about 4300 dollars in losses and I held actually 25 hundred shares overnight. In case it would gap down. Right now it looks like it's gapping up slightly and you know it's that's a tiny size. I really never got in full size intro day. I had like 5,000 shares at the most. I had a core of about 2 grand that I, sorry, 2,000 shares that I got in here at low 15s and just drying it me. I tried. I got to half size a couple of dimes but I got stopped out of the ads. So that's where my losses and that one came from. And again, you know if this thing can go to 17, 17, 15, today I'll be in more size because the setup will be so much better. It's like up like 6, 7, 8 days in a row. It's up on a regulatory ruling, some kind of poly, you know, like macro stuff, government policy on China, tariffs, tariffs for imported aluminum or something like that. Vietnam, I've been in this thing for a while now for a few days. I really not doing it.
