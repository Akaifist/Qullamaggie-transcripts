## 🎯 Key Highlights

### [00:00 - 13:36] Highlight 1

with yesterday's trades and my current positions. So I bought this LGCY as a swing trade. At $2.60 here, it's also a big volume coming in. And the short was really good, flagging nicely. Former runner, very beaten down stock. So I think this thing, first stop is going to be $3 on this one. I did about 20,000 shares. Yeah, exactly 20,000 shares, 259 average. So yeah, let's see how it works out. The EMEX, I've been in this thing since this day here. I had a really nice looking break out here on some volume. Also beaten down, oil name. And I have about the third left. And now every sell I made on the way up looks idiotic in hindsight. It looks like it wants to go to 20. And I'll probably sell my last shares here, if it gets here. My trailing stop is now here, but probably 16 bucks. VNR, I've been in this thing since last week, from the low 80s. I sold some today. Still have some, I think. May go to 120s or something. My stop is probably going to be here low 90s. Pola, I took a position in this one yesterday, but I got out of it. I didn't hold it overnight. Same earnings in a few days. But it looks good. It had some volume out of the gate, but there was no follow through at all. No more volume and no price increase. So I would have probably sold it anyways, even if the earnings wasn't coming in a few days. MBLX, this is unrelated, unrelated. I stayed charbed long from here. I still have, I think, about half left. Trailing stop is here in the mid 14s. I think this thing may go to 20 possibly. It's a very explosive, a growth stock, a recent IPO. I like it. If it goes sideways another 3 to 5 days, then. So the 20 day can catch up and then breaks up. I may add more to this one. Tesla, I shorted it on the opening range lows here on this day here. Opening range lows. And I think this thing could fade back to mid low to 40s. It's a very over extended straight up in a line. I thought it was a good risk to order. Stop is going to be here about 257s or so. MBL actually closed this one out yesterday. Had an I-PIO breakout here, no follow through. So, AFI bought it a few days ago and this breakout, all the building materials, stocks broke out. This is a recent IPO. Stop is going to be high 20s or so. Two bought it here. Last time it broke out of a bottom, like it did here, had a nice, nice multi week run. It got rejected of the 50 days. So I'm probably going to use yesterday's lows here 25s, 60s or so as my stock. Because this thing could do like Asia, I had it or let it this week. I bought it here. Got rejected of the 50 days. I was up 3 grand and ended up taking a $1,700 loss on it and I just kept going down even more. I'm afraid this could do something like this. I'm just going to tighten up my stock pretty aggressively on this one. CNX. This has been a frustrating stock. I took a loss on it on this day. Then I had a huge score. I was up like 14 grand on it on this day here. Then I grinded back to the rest of the day. I was up 14 grand here, had to lose. But I wasn't fast enough to put in beats because it just flushed 50, 70 cents, like inside about 30 seconds or something. Then I grinded back and taking a $2,000 profit on it after being up 14 grand. Yesterday I added when it went to red. I did some shares, covered some on the weakness. I'm just keeping 5,000 shares now overnight. The episode, this is not a real average. Everything I'm holding overnight in this account, the position average gets changed to the previous days close. So this is not my real P&L. These were my trades initiated yesterday. This is the real average, but these are not. So CNX, my real average is probably slightly higher. Again I think this is against fade below 14, or at least a low 14, maybe even to high 13 or something. But the stock is going to be here, 1580s. That's why I already saw some volume coming in, had a nice bottom shot. I know it's a pump. I don't think they try. Especially this one, the chatroom tries to pump it repeatedly. But one of these days it may go. It's putting in higher lows as a nice phrase. This thing had a big run a few months back, with up 100% in a day. So I thought the risk of water is pretty good. I bought it here at 29, 30s. I bought 50,000 shares. Then didn't have no follow. I tried to get out on off-trest, but this thing barely traded after that first hour. I only got out some. I still have 35,000 shares, 30s and average. Gonna try to get out. Rest today. UEC, this one I had from here, high 60s, no follow through. So I took a little bit of a loss on it. Yesterday, got stopped out here in the wall. Basically break even. Telecast, I had a few days ago, no follow through. This is toxic financing. So they're just gonna be sub 30 very soon. So these were my trades. Took my short watch list, TBIO, nothing here yet. Nothing here yet. This one, I had some good trades on it. It's week. Now it's bouncing. I'm hoping it can go to 270s or maybe 280s to initiate the new swing short. L and C up, nicely. Three days in a row. Not a big move. It's only like a 16% move. But it's very liquid. You can do a lot of side. This is something, you know, a good interday setup. You can maybe risk 20, 30 cents on it, possibly make a buck, buck 50. Hopefully it can push to like, mid high 50. No, like 52 bucks even today. That would be nice. I would be looking for a setup on it. Ariane, just talking it. Hopefully it can extend to 50 plus. That would be great. Long watch list. I'll reexec some just stalking it. Over 80 cents, I would be interested. Had a nice recent run. AXIM. I am looking for a breakout out of this area here. Hopefully good side is for a few more days. This is not ready yet. I'm just stalking it. Not ready yet. Not ready yet. Like these are always stalked there. They're all going to break down or break out the same day, probably. Just watching. It's getting tight, riding this 50 day, rising moving average. You know, a few more days and then a breakout out of this formation. It could be good. This thing could go up to 10 or something. I pay a try. Look. Not tight enough. DNR, this looks really good. The 50 days caught up pretty nice long lag. If you can have some breakout here and volume that would be nice. This is a very liquid stalk. You can do pretty decent size. I'm just looking for a breakout and volume on all of these. This is a recent IPO. Putting in higher lows here on this 60-minute chart. It has a range shared 47-30s. Couple more days. These would be nice. Nah, it's not ready. Basically I'm looking for a breakout on all of these. Or where I expected. I traded it a couple of days ago. I had some news so gaped up. I bought it on opening range highs. It's spiked like 20 cents instantly, 30 cents actually. And then it just faded back there to the small loss on it. I'm still holding this rising trend line. If it tries to break out again above this 360-365 area, I'm going to trade it again. Special volume comes in this one. Not ready yet. This dries. There's selling paper. There's no tomorrow. It's down. Four sessions. This thing is down 65% in the last four sessions alone. And before that it was down almost 80%. So this is just beaten like crazy. They probably have 10-some millions more shares to sell. So it doesn't have to bounce, but it can bounce. And the more extended it gets to the downside. Let's look at this clean down days. It had in a row. Serious of clean down days. Why can't this thing bounce 50 cents or something? A boxed in today. Here it actually had a nice bounce about two weeks ago. Bounce 30% in today. So on here, I think it was this week actually, had a bounce of 20% in today. It could be a 20% or 30% in today. I want to be there. If I can find a set up where I can risk 20 cents, possibly make... I don't know, risk 10-15-20 cents, possibly 50-80 cents or something. That would be great. Again, the cam bounce. But yeah, got to be careful. I'd like to see something like higher lows or some kind of a sideways action. Because as you can see, it just puts it lower highs all the time, all the time, all the time. Then it rallies into resistance fades off, fades off. So you want to see some kind of a range taken. I'd like here, it took out the range to the upside and had a nice bounce. So yeah, it's kind of hard to explain what I'm looking for. When I see it, I see it. Okay, so what more did I trade? Let's see, I'm looking at my logs. I did some dealt. I saw some volume coming in, so I bought. But then I saw a chatroom was pumping. I sold it pretty much break even. Let's see, dealt. Pretty much break even. AVGR. This is one of these are knowing five set spread stocks. I bought it here on the consolidation. I was thinking maybe it has another leg up, but it didn't. So it took us more loss on it. HLF tried to short it. I don't know exactly how I lost on the short side today, but I did. I kind of chased it a little bit. And then I stopped out when it looked like it was going to go green. So I was actually up a couple of grand on it. Yeah, whatever. Was it the high-commission trade anyways? Oh yeah, by the way, dry. I did try some on the long side. Yes, Jay, but yeah, got stopped out. That was a little bit too eager. Thank for that. It's only tiny size. I was in like quarter size or something. And that's about it. Yeah. Okay.

**[01:21]** I sold some today.

**[01:23]** Still have some, I think.

**[01:24]** May go to 120s or something.

**[01:27]** My stop is probably going to be here low 90s.

**[01:32]** Pola, I took a position in this one yesterday, but I got out of it.

**[01:39]** I didn't hold it overnight.

**[01:41]** Same earnings in a few days.

**[01:44]** But it looks good.

**[01:45]** It had some volume out of the gate, but there was no follow through at all.

**[01:50]** No more volume and no price increase.

**[01:53]** So I would have probably sold it anyways, even if the earnings wasn't coming in a few

**[01:58]** days.

**[01:59]** MBLX, this is unrelated, unrelated.

**[02:02]** I stayed charbed long from here.

**[02:05]** I still have, I think, about half left.

**[02:08]** Trailing stop is here in the mid 14s.

**[02:11]** I think this thing may go to 20 possibly.

**[02:13]** It's a very explosive, a growth stock, a recent IPO.

**[02:17]** I like it.

**[02:18]** If it goes sideways another 3 to 5 days, then.

**[02:21]** So the 20 day can catch up and then breaks up.

**[02:24]** I may add more to this one.

**[02:27]** Tesla, I shorted it on the opening range lows here on this day here.

**[02:32]** Opening range lows.

**[02:35]** And I think this thing could fade back to mid low to 40s.

**[02:40]** It's a very over extended straight up in a line.

**[02:44]** I thought it was a good risk to order.

**[02:46]** Stop is going to be here about 257s or so.

**[02:49]** MBL actually closed this one out yesterday.

**[02:54]** Had an I-PIO breakout here, no follow through.

**[02:57]** So, AFI bought it a few days ago and this breakout, all the building materials, stocks broke

**[03:03]** out.

**[03:04]** This is a recent IPO.

**[03:08]** Stop is going to be high 20s or so.

**[03:13]** Two bought it here.

**[03:17]** Last time it broke out of a bottom, like it did here, had a nice, nice multi week run.

**[03:22]** It got rejected of the 50 days.

**[03:24]** So I'm probably going to use yesterday's lows here 25s, 60s or so as my stock.

**[03:32]** Because this thing could do like Asia, I had it or let it this week.

**[03:36]** I bought it here.

**[03:38]** Got rejected of the 50 days.

**[03:40]** I was up 3 grand and ended up taking a $1,700 loss on it and I just kept going down even

**[03:45]** more.

**[03:46]** I'm afraid this could do something like this.

**[03:50]** I'm just going to tighten up my stock pretty aggressively on this one.

**[03:54]** CNX.

**[03:55]** This has been a frustrating stock.

**[03:58]** I took a loss on it on this day.

**[04:02]** Then I had a huge score.

**[04:03]** I was up like 14 grand on it on this day here.

**[04:08]** Then I grinded back to the rest of the day.

**[04:11]** I was up 14 grand here, had to lose.

**[04:14]** But I wasn't fast enough to put in beats because it just flushed 50, 70 cents, like inside

**[04:21]** about 30 seconds or something.

**[04:24]** Then I grinded back and taking a $2,000 profit on it after being up 14 grand.

**[04:32]** Yesterday I added when it went to red.

**[04:37]** I did some shares, covered some on the weakness.

**[04:40]** I'm just keeping 5,000 shares now overnight.

**[04:45]** The episode, this is not a real average.

**[04:50]** Everything I'm holding overnight in this account, the position average gets changed to the

**[04:56]** previous days close.

**[04:59]** So this is not my real P&L.

**[05:01]** These were my trades initiated yesterday.

**[05:05]** This is the real average, but these are not.

**[05:08]** So CNX, my real average is probably slightly higher.

**[05:18]** Again I think this is against fade below 14, or at least a low 14, maybe even to high 13

**[05:24]** or something.

**[05:25]** But the stock is going to be here, 1580s.

**[05:29]** That's why I already saw some volume coming in, had a nice bottom shot.

**[05:32]** I know it's a pump.

**[05:33]** I don't think they try.

**[05:35]** Especially this one, the chatroom tries to pump it repeatedly.

**[05:39]** But one of these days it may go.

**[05:41]** It's putting in higher lows as a nice phrase.

**[05:43]** This thing had a big run a few months back, with up 100% in a day.

**[05:48]** So I thought the risk of water is pretty good.

**[05:50]** I bought it here at 29, 30s.

**[05:52]** I bought 50,000 shares.

**[05:54]** Then didn't have no follow.

**[05:55]** I tried to get out on off-trest, but this thing barely traded after that first hour.

**[06:01]** I only got out some.

**[06:02]** I still have 35,000 shares, 30s and average.

**[06:08]** Gonna try to get out.

**[06:09]** Rest today.

**[06:13]** UEC, this one I had from here, high 60s, no follow through.

**[06:20]** So I took a little bit of a loss on it.

**[06:22]** Yesterday, got stopped out here in the wall.

**[06:25]** Basically break even.

**[06:28]** Telecast, I had a few days ago, no follow through.

**[06:31]** This is toxic financing.

**[06:33]** So they're just gonna be sub 30 very soon.

**[06:38]** So these were my trades.

**[06:42]** Took my short watch list, TBIO, nothing here yet.

**[06:48]** Nothing here yet.

**[06:50]** This one, I had some good trades on it.

**[06:53]** It's week.

**[06:54]** Now it's bouncing.

**[06:55]** I'm hoping it can go to 270s or maybe 280s to initiate the new swing short.

**[07:09]** L and C up, nicely.

**[07:12]** Three days in a row.

**[07:13]** Not a big move.

**[07:14]** It's only like a 16% move.

**[07:16]** But it's very liquid.

**[07:18]** You can do a lot of side.

**[07:20]** This is something, you know, a good interday setup.

**[07:23]** You can maybe risk 20, 30 cents on it, possibly make a buck, buck 50.

**[07:29]** Hopefully it can push to like, mid high 50.

**[07:33]** No, like 52 bucks even today.

**[07:36]** That would be nice.

**[07:37]** I would be looking for a setup on it.

**[07:39]** Ariane, just talking it.

**[07:42]** Hopefully it can extend to 50 plus.

**[07:44]** That would be great.

**[07:48]** Long watch list.

**[07:50]** I'll reexec some just stalking it.

**[07:53]** Over 80 cents, I would be interested.

**[07:55]** Had a nice recent run.

**[07:59]** AXIM.

**[08:02]** I am looking for a breakout out of this area here.

**[08:09]** Hopefully good side is for a few more days.

**[08:11]** This is not ready yet.

**[08:13]** I'm just stalking it.

**[08:14]** Not ready yet.

**[08:15]** Not ready yet.

**[08:16]** Like these are always stalked there.

**[08:18]** They're all going to break down or break out the same day, probably.

**[08:22]** Just watching.

**[08:23]** It's getting tight, riding this 50 day, rising moving average.

**[08:28]** You know, a few more days and then a breakout out of this formation.

**[08:31]** It could be good.

**[08:32]** This thing could go up to 10 or something.

**[08:34]** I pay a try.

**[08:37]** Look.

**[08:39]** Not tight enough.

**[08:41]** DNR, this looks really good.

**[08:43]** The 50 days caught up pretty nice long lag.

**[08:46]** If you can have some breakout here and volume that would be nice.

**[08:50]** This is a very liquid stalk.

**[08:52]** You can do pretty decent size.

**[08:55]** I'm just looking for a breakout and volume on all of these.

**[09:00]** This is a recent IPO.

**[09:02]** Putting in higher lows here on this 60-minute chart.

**[09:05]** It has a range shared 47-30s.

**[09:08]** Couple more days.

**[09:10]** These would be nice.

**[09:13]** Nah, it's not ready.

**[09:18]** Basically I'm looking for a breakout on all of these.

**[09:23]** Or where I expected.

**[09:24]** I traded it a couple of days ago.

**[09:26]** I had some news so gaped up.

**[09:28]** I bought it on opening range highs.

**[09:31]** It's spiked like 20 cents instantly, 30 cents actually.

**[09:35]** And then it just faded back there to the small loss on it.

**[09:38]** I'm still holding this rising trend line.

**[09:43]** If it tries to break out again above this 360-365 area,

**[09:48]** I'm going to trade it again.

**[09:51]** Special volume comes in this one.

**[09:54]** Not ready yet.

**[09:57]** This dries.

**[09:59]** There's selling paper.

**[10:01]** There's no tomorrow.

**[10:03]** It's down.

**[10:04]** Four sessions.

**[10:06]** This thing is down 65% in the last four sessions alone.

**[10:13]** And before that it was down almost 80%.

**[10:18]** So this is just beaten like crazy.

**[10:21]** They probably have 10-some millions more shares to sell.

**[10:25]** So it doesn't have to bounce, but it can bounce.

**[10:29]** And the more extended it gets to the downside.

**[10:32]** Let's look at this clean down days.

**[10:35]** It had in a row.

**[10:36]** Serious of clean down days.

**[10:38]** Why can't this thing bounce 50 cents or something?

**[10:41]** A boxed in today.

**[10:42]** Here it actually had a nice bounce about two weeks ago.

**[10:47]** Bounce 30% in today.

**[10:50]** So on here, I think it was this week actually,

**[10:56]** had a bounce of 20% in today.

**[11:00]** It could be a 20% or 30% in today.

**[11:03]** I want to be there.

**[11:04]** If I can find a set up where I can risk 20 cents,

**[11:08]** possibly make...

**[11:13]** I don't know, risk 10-15-20 cents, possibly 50-80 cents or something.

**[11:18]** That would be great.

**[11:20]** Again, the cam bounce.

**[11:22]** But yeah, got to be careful.

**[11:29]** I'd like to see something like higher lows or some kind of a sideways action.

**[11:36]** Because as you can see, it just puts it lower highs all the time,

**[11:40]** all the time, all the time.

**[11:41]** Then it rallies into resistance fades off, fades off.

**[11:44]** So you want to see some kind of a range taken.

**[11:47]** I'd like here, it took out the range to the upside and had a nice bounce.

**[11:53]** So yeah, it's kind of hard to explain what I'm looking for.

**[11:57]** When I see it, I see it.

**[12:00]** Okay, so what more did I trade?

**[12:03]** Let's see, I'm looking at my logs.

**[12:08]** I did some dealt.

**[12:11]** I saw some volume coming in, so I bought.

**[12:14]** But then I saw a chatroom was pumping.

**[12:16]** I sold it pretty much break even.

**[12:21]** Let's see, dealt.

**[12:23]** Pretty much break even.

**[12:26]** AVGR.

**[12:29]** This is one of these are knowing five set spread stocks.

**[12:34]** I bought it here on the consolidation.

**[12:37]** I was thinking maybe it has another leg up, but it didn't.

**[12:41]** So it took us more loss on it.

**[12:44]** HLF tried to short it.

**[12:47]** I don't know exactly how I lost on the short side today, but I did.

**[12:51]** I kind of chased it a little bit.

**[12:54]** And then I stopped out when it looked like it was going to go green.

**[12:57]** So I was actually up a couple of grand on it.

**[13:01]** Yeah, whatever.

**[13:03]** Was it the high-commission trade anyways?

**[13:07]** Oh yeah, by the way, dry.

**[13:09]** I did try some on the long side.

**[13:12]** Yes, Jay, but yeah, got stopped out.

**[13:16]** That was a little bit too eager.

**[13:19]** Thank for that.

**[13:20]** It's only tiny size.

**[13:21]** I was in like quarter size or something.

**[13:26]** And that's about it.

**[13:33]** Yeah.

**[13:34]** Okay.
