## 🎯 Key Highlights

### [00:00 - 29:00] Highlight 1

So this video will be in two parts. The first part I'll go do recap of Monday's training and the second part will be watchlist for Tuesday. I'm watching this dries. They have toxic financing so they've just been selling paper for months and months but it's kind of starting to get overstanding on a long side. It's sound like 80% just the past three weeks or something. May have a snapback move but I would probably need to sell off one more day and then it may have a snapback. I'm not just you know keeping an eye on it in case there's a good intro they set up. APRI it's really an ETRM sympathy trade but it's starting to build a little bit of a rain share so if it's get some volume through this range may be a long set up belt. Not sensing. So let's see this is a weed stock I'm just tracking. Preferably go sideways for another few days but if it starts purging with volume here may be a long set up. I was actually almost filled here on this day and a really good breakout but I didn't get filled I was very I was for a few pennies from getting filled I didn't want to chase it so I was sitting on a bin but yeah miss this one a little bit annoying because it made a huge move. I did short it here on the opening range lows. I don't you know it went down like almost 50% in two sessions so that was a good trade but yeah now it looks like it may be setting up again but it's preferfully go sideways for a few more days it's it's not really ready yet. ACBFF not a weed stock. Tick-pair care on volume and thinking about buying it today. I haven't really decided yet. Urg Uranium stock starting to set up starting to look very good on a 60 minute same thing with UEC this one looks even better. These things can go. These things can go. Uranium has been put for about the month now. Also URE is another one they had an offering. Some are truly sure about this one maybe a bit of overhang CCJ. Yeah they have they have the bath guidance so it got down so there's no really no setup here. This is another Uranium name. It looks really good on the 60 minute. Higher lows has a range here at 365-ish so this thing could have another leg up. It can go and make a big move so this is definitely a very close watch. This is a gold name. I'll go through the gold trade later. Ancheum also this move started with a seeking out particle. Now it's just going sideways building a flag. Also very interesting name. Another gold name. PTALA biotech just going sideways. A phenomenon was just tracking it probably. It needs to set up another few days but this is something and how things move. CTIC I don't know what this is doing here. Asia and Velio you know two recent IPOs that have big big rounds are literally here. It looks like they have been bottoming now but they are probably not ready yet. I'll track them because in a few days you know they may break out and make some nice moves into earnings. I think it both have earnings in a couple of weeks. They may make big moves. This one doesn't look that good. I'm just tracking it. This is kind of a long set up. It's like on the long side you have a big move, a sideways action and then you get this moving area just that catch up. Usually when they catch up these things you know when they break out out of that formation you can make really big moves. GWPH not really ready yet. A recent IPO I'm just tracking it. I always track recent IPOs because especially with good short patterns because these things can really go and technical analysis works very well on recent IPOs. Polar another thing here. If it perks with volume could be a swing. I'm actually bored here on this thing here but didn't have any follow true so I took actually pretty decent loss on it. Not that I had an enormous amount of size or anything but I had too much size in relation to the volume so I had huge slippage here. I think you know I had an only made in stop loss at 950. I think I got filled up like low 9 or something and it was just ridiculous. So stupid. I think I'd like 4,000 shares and this thing you know I wanted to do more but you know it's very thin stock traded like it's like 100 to 100,000 shares on average. Many days only 50,000 shares so this one looks pretty good and again 50 days has almost scored up with the price. You know me go. This is another recent IPO. It's flagging here high lows in the 60 minute. Me go 50, the 50 days catching up blue. If it breaks out maybe a good setup. No no. Yeah again maybe. So I know this one actually I'm gonna set on a little bit of this one PMD super super thin stock. Actually I'm gonna remove it later. This is too thin for me. Golf recent IPO. It breaks this range share volume could have some follow through. Coup another bottoming recent IPO had a big big move here. I've been traded. I should have I saw this break out. So you can see I had a little arrow here just for putting it here for tracking purposes and you know that's a really good follow through. CRK still goes sideways. Another recent IPO. This is a biotech that's actually holding up very well. Biotechs have been very very weak to past couple of weeks and this is one of the few that's holding up. So you know it's a biotech stock going down or start going sideways or even start going up this thing and have a big big move. 50 days almost caught up with the price and this is actually exactly what I want to see this kind of setups. Again all you got is name probably needs more time. Another one is interesting on a 50 day. You know these things are not gonna do anything unless this oil names as a whole group break out. As you can see this one broke down out of this range today but this one is holding up. To do cheap row. No I don't know. If it has huge volume on a break out I may do it again just tracking this one. Another shinkler. P&R again. Oil name just needs to break out with a group. CRC does not look good. WTI. I'd feel a bit extended I'll remove it. I'll just see why. I just gonna set a alert for a range break here. I need to look at it every day. Let's see some shorts. This one I was thinking about training on the Monday but it's just a little bit on the theme side. I really wanted that 556 push but it didn't materialize. So I'm gonna trade here. What has some short article? You know this is a very disputed stock. Some people are usually bullish. Some people are usually bearish. I lean on the bearish side. I think there's too much height. There's like 99% probability. It's not gonna be in the next iPhone. Just all evidence points against it. But it's holding up. A lot of retail people they just refuse to. See the facts. But yeah I don't know when the next iPhone announcement is but it may be a great great short when that happens. Or yet I'm just tracking. I had a huge move. Looks has a little bit of a range here in the 60 minute. It breaks down here. You could have a couple of dollars downside. This is more of a swing try. A trade kind of short. I'm just tracking it. If it looks great on the internet short, I may do it. But if it like shows relative weakness or something, that's always a good sign. But so far, past six months it's only been showing relative strength. I had a good short. Damn this. So much taste. Let's see. Where is it? Here it is. I had a good short. When it broke below this range here, I'm very good short. I went down like 25% in up three, four or five days. So I'm thinking you know sensing may happen here. It's not gonna go up for all eternity. You know, it's this going to pull back. But it's still a little bit dangerous. I think long term, I think this thing has more upside. Fundamentally, they have some good stock going. Or them. So I wouldn't be surprised to see this thing go up another 10, 20 bucks, 30 bucks whatever. But short term, I think this may pull back to at least a 50 day or something. In video, this is, I was actually shorted for a couple of weeks. I shorted in here. I'm opening range lows or actually not open. Yeah, opening range lows in this day. Shorted somewhere here. I had a really good short on it. And I actually covered it yesterday because it's you know, just going sideways since. So I'm gonna remove this one. Test law. I'm tracking it. Hopefully it goes to about 26. There's something. But you know, this is straight up. Yeah, it's gonna pull back eventually. Like same thing in February, March, Wednesday, up. I had some really good short. So I mean, that was early a couple of times. So I took a you know, some losses on the way up. But then it's been one day finally started actually starting going down. So that was great. So I'm looking for something similar here. Maybe a couple more days upside and then a pull back by the 20 day, the yellow line here. I had a fine. I close kind of week. I'll watch this one. See you next again. I lost on it Friday. I did not trade in Monday. I was thinking about it. But it just, nah, just when SID was in a range, it was nothing there. But now starting to look really interesting. You know, I prefer it goes to like 15 or something today. But we'll see. I'm gonna look at something like opening range lows or green to red or lower highs or late day fades. Something like that. I'm not gonna short-drandly mean to strength. I want to see some kind of weakness first. They'll also need to go up another day. It's probably not ready yet. They starting to get a big stand. Then you know, huge move from the lows here. It's just going higher, higher, higher. It will have a snapback eventually. Especially going close to like 11, 11, 50 or 12 or something like that. You will have a snapback. Shane, I've been very sure of this thing for a few days. It trades on gold. So if gold goes down, that thing will go down. Gold is a little bit extended. So Shane, it looks like a great breakout chart from this little flag formation. But this thing doesn't trade like a stock. So I don't know. I'd rather short it. I'm not gonna pick any tops on it. I'm not gonna trade them alongside. This thing is programmed to go to zero. This is all this trip lead. As you can see, there's like reverse blade, reverse blade because you know, it just keeps going down, down, down. This thing was 200 bucks. And you know, once it gets down like some file or something like that, they're gonna do reverse blade again. She'll be us. Now this is an interesting one. They're trying to do an offering, but it's not going through for some reason. I don't know the details, but basically, a lot of people have been shorting it the past week because there's an offering coming. They're trying to do an offering. So they're gonna get a bad bad price on it because you know, they really don't demand for the offering. The ones wants to buy this piece of shit, even though that is discounted. So I've actually couple of trades in it, in this one. One is on the long side. As you can see, this 12 area has been, now everybody has been rejected. So if it starts breaking, this will involve you, especially later in the day. Let's say it goes sideways whole day on Tuesday, starts breaking up on high volume. And this thing haven't been running to the close. Nothing I would hold overnight. And it could also be a short day. I'll see about it. Had a 300% move from the low. So it's both a long and a short. The short I would hold overnight, especially if the close is very weak. That's something I would hold overnight. And again, this is really starting to set up nicely. The story here is basically, as you can see, this thing was a 22 bucks back in 2011. And now, then it got down to 25 cents, actually 20 cents, and now we set, actually it was at 360, 358, 7, in half the hour, some long days. So this thing can keep going. Okay. There's something I've learned from shorting momentum stocks is don't be too early. This thing needs to go, I think this thing can go to 4 or 5 bucks in a straight line. So the short here, I'm probably not going to short it on a while today. So, the idea to know I would be if it goes up all day, close is strong, and then has some more follow through on Wednesday. That would be something that I will be very interested in. But right now, just tracking it, I made it small size because I'm always affected by a fair missing out. So I'll try to do it like 10 to my normal size or something, or 20 percent to my normal size, just to be in it, just to feel like if it goes down without going to 4 or 5 bucks first, still participate a little bit. But again, if it goes like 5 or something, I'll be investing huge size. If it goes up today and then on Wednesday, I have no problem shorting 50 or 100 dollars a share with this thing. Try to catch like a 50 cent move on the downside or something like that or even a dollar move on the downside. Actually, if it goes like 4 or 5, probably. The move that will probably be a dollar in a day or two. But we'll see, this is something again set up and be a huge trade. OWCP had a big run, made it, and now it's been bouncy for two days. I'm thinking if this thing can go green the red, it may fade back to some 50 cents or something like that. In that case, this will be a dead cat bounce. But it can also keep going. But again, I'm looking for weakness, strong open and then just fizzle off. That's something I would be interested in. MIHI. I really want 120's, 130's first. It really needs to go up another day, I think. I probably won't look at it today. Let's go through some. Oh, whatever. I was going to tell the story about the NAK. So they're sitting on huge gold reserves in Alaska. What happened this, the Obama administration, they were very environmentally protective. So these guys couldn't, they didn't get the mining permits for their reserves. So it's been just been going down, down, down. They've just been bleeding cash and whatnot. And now, since Trump got elected, Trump doesn't give the government an environment. So the market is really anticipating that they may get the permits to get their gold and silver out, because they're really sitting on huge reserves. And if they get those permits through, I mean, this thing can go back to 10, 15, 20 bucks. But again, on short terms, very standard. This thing will pull back. It probably needs to go up a couple more bucks. Again, I'm really excited about this one, because it can be a really big trade, if it says it's upright. So you don't get these ones very often. Just that is really quick too. Even though it's low price, you can do a lot of size. So that's not very interested in. Now I'm just repeating myself, sorry for that. Now, let's look at another watch list. You know what I do is I usually track when when stocks break out to break down, especially if there's news on them, I usually track them. If I don't trade them, most of the time I don't trade them. But it's fun to track them and look back a couple of weeks or even a couple of months later and see what they did. You know, this is another bottom bio, had some volume broke. GSV Gold named really good break out here. Decent volume ads, it's still kind of thin name, low price, but you know, relatively close high volume. Good go. Especially gold keeps going and very easy to go with three bucks. EZO or a Y had some news. Amazon is starting to take their business. So they all broke down. So let's see if they keep going down. Maybe a shy home builder had a nice little volume break out here. Father, NTS, Momo, old Chinese stocks, nice high volume breakouts. This Momo I almost bought it, but I don't know, I hesitated and then it went higher and I didn't want to chase it. But it looks really good. You have a tight, tight flag, recent momentum name, no distinct, nice moves. You can very easily go back to 26, 27 bucks. NTS, recent IPO, it doesn't really look that good here. You know, here it had a break out from the bottom in range, had a big move, 30%. Let's see, maybe it goes. Google looks great at earnings later this week, but can go to like 860, 870s, maybe not 870s, but 860s is very possible before that. OLED, a high volume range break here. I usually want to see tightness before the break out day. You know, something like this, you know, a couple of tight candles before the break out. But it has some decent volumes on tracking it anyways. CMRX and other one, bottom biotech can go to like 6657. You hold, this was nice, flag, tight, tight for solidation and the brilliantly high volume break out. It's a very thin start, but it's high priced, so the dollar volume is actually pretty decent at. NTS, recent IPO, didn't really have any volume, but it bounced on the 50 day, you know, long, smooth, nice, clean up trend. This is exactly what I want to see on the long setups. And then a bounce off the, of moving average is like 20, 50 or the ones that I usually trade. This is the bottom stock as big volume. What I understand from the news, this is pretty much cap tier at 435, 440. What we'll see, AP also, at Amazon News, got down. VIAV, nice breakout, huge volume, 7 million shares. This is something I'm going to do a lot of size, but I didn't see it in my scans, I maybe wouldn't bought it. Here in the high AD, these 870, say 80s, but I didn't see it for some reason. I tube, Latin American bank, Latin American stocks have been pre-stronged the best couple of weeks. Many of them have been straight up. So it's a little bit extended, but yeah, it looks okay. Just tracking it. This is something I'm thinking about buying on Tuesday, another weed stock. These things can really be made, baby moves. Max, now this is probably running on the Trump policy thingy, or not the policy, but they're thinking about moving their US embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and this is an Israeli security name. So it's probably being pumped on that. Didn't have a huge volume, relatively tiny big volume, but relative to its float in town, I would have preferred to see a couple of million shares traded. This thing can go. This thing can have made big moves in the past. Coped me a few years ago. This thing can go to like a 10 box, but again, it still trades a little bit, so probably not going to look at it. Maybe it's set up in a few weeks or so, but this is, you know, it could really go. This is the kind of stock that these chat rooms and stuff. They love to pump these, you know, when they have a catalyst, like that macro, macro catalyst. You know, it can really go. Beard, a little bit of breakout here. High volume, nice. Just keeping track of it. Looking up a back in a few weeks from now and see what it did. Giga, very thin name, very thin name, but it's a beaten down bottom micro cap name and can go to one 50 or something. Mankind, another one. I was thinking about buying it. It's this thing as a history of huge runs. Like I said in the last video, I think I made it on Friday or during the weekend. This thing can go 100%. If it goes, it's made it in a five-minute time again, but really didn't have the volume I was looking for. So I didn't buy it. Excel, you know, another five-minute telling up very, very well. This five-minute thing, you know, maybe a week, most of them have broken down, but this is holding like a shab. You know, I would prefer more sideways action. It's not really ready yet. Chewie had a great, great breakout. Short term, a bit extended. I was thinking about buying it, but it feels a bit extended. This kind of a fight, fighting would have been nicer here, but now it's a feels-pipped extended. Okay, that's it. So the video is a little bit longer than I thought it would be. So I'm gonna try to keep it shorter next time, but I'm new to this YouTube video making thing so bear with me. Okay, good luck. On Tuesday. Oh, by the way, I forgot about this one. Actually, I forgot to do this recap thing. If you follow me on Twitter, you know I've been on this one since Thursday or Friday on the short side. I traded it on Monday. No, Friday, I did really good trade on it, and I traded it again on Monday. I had another really good trade on it. I traded the opening range lows just before it went red. This one only is three trades like Dave, B and R. I actually forwarded on Friday in another account. This day I saw some volume coming in, and it's basically bottomed out. Higher lows. This is 60 minutes short. As you can see, this made a huge move up to the month back. I'm not through, so I bought some more in the account I showed you. I bought it here in the sixth sense, tiny size since I was already in Longtees and size from Friday. I came back in, I saw this front loss. I really didn't want to see a weak lows like this. And I also traded GLBS on the long side because let's look at the 5 minute short. I had some volume coming in late day. I was actually not like to run on it, but then I started going back down. I'm like, okay, I'm not going to hold it overnight anyway, so I'll just sell it. Okay, that's it.

## 📝 Full Transcription

**[00:00]** So this video will be in two parts. The first part I'll go do recap of

**[00:06]** Monday's training and the second part will be watchlist for Tuesday. I'm watching

**[00:13]** this dries. They have toxic financing so they've just been selling paper for

**[00:18]** months and months but it's kind of starting to get overstanding on a long

**[00:24]** side. It's sound like 80% just the past three weeks or something. May have a

**[00:29]** snapback move but I would probably need to sell off one more day and then it

**[00:36]** may have a snapback. I'm not just you know keeping an eye on it in case there's

**[00:41]** a good intro they set up. APRI it's really an ETRM sympathy trade but it's

**[00:47]** starting to build a little bit of a rain share so if it's get some volume

**[00:53]** through this range may be a long set up belt. Not sensing. So let's see this is a

**[01:02]** weed stock I'm just tracking. Preferably go sideways for another few days but if

**[01:09]** it starts purging with volume here may be a long set up. I was actually

**[01:16]** almost filled here on this day and a really good breakout but I didn't get filled

**[01:24]** I was very I was for a few pennies from getting filled I didn't want to chase it

**[01:27]** so I was sitting on a bin but yeah miss this one a little bit annoying because it

**[01:34]** made a huge move. I did short it here on the opening range lows. I don't you know

**[01:40]** it went down like almost 50% in two sessions so that was a good trade but yeah

**[01:45]** now it looks like it may be setting up again but it's preferfully go sideways for a

**[01:51]** few more days it's it's not really ready yet. ACBFF not a weed stock. Tick-pair

**[01:58]** care on volume and thinking about buying it today. I haven't really decided yet.

**[02:10]** Urg Uranium stock starting to set up starting to look very good on a 60 minute

**[02:17]** same thing with UEC this one looks even better. These things can go. These things

**[02:25]** can go. Uranium has been put for about the month now. Also URE is another one

**[02:32]** they had an offering. Some are truly sure about this one maybe a bit of

**[02:38]** overhang CCJ. Yeah they have they have the bath guidance so it got down so

**[02:47]** there's no really no setup here. This is another Uranium name. It looks really

**[02:55]** good on the 60 minute. Higher lows has a range here at 365-ish so this thing

**[03:03]** could have another leg up. It can go and make a big move so this is definitely a

**[03:09]** very close watch. This is a gold name. I'll go through the gold trade later.

**[03:15]** Ancheum also this move started with a seeking out particle. Now it's just going

**[03:25]** sideways building a flag. Also very interesting name. Another gold name.

**[03:33]** PTALA biotech just going sideways. A phenomenon was just tracking it probably. It needs to set

**[03:42]** up another few days but this is something and how things move. CTIC I don't know

**[03:47]** what this is doing here. Asia and Velio you know two recent IPOs that have

**[03:55]** big big rounds are literally here. It looks like they have been bottoming now but

**[04:02]** they are probably not ready yet. I'll track them because in a few days you know

**[04:12]** they may break out and make some nice moves into earnings. I think it both have

**[04:17]** earnings in a couple of weeks. They may make big moves. This one doesn't look that good.

**[04:26]** I'm just tracking it. This is kind of a long set up. It's like on the long side you have a big

**[04:34]** move, a sideways action and then you get this moving area just that catch up.

**[04:39]** Usually when they catch up these things you know when they break out out of

**[04:46]** that formation you can make really big moves.

**[04:49]** GWPH not really ready yet. A recent IPO I'm just tracking it. I always track recent

**[04:57]** IPOs because especially with good short patterns because these things can really go and technical

**[05:04]** analysis works very well on recent IPOs.

**[05:08]** Polar another thing here. If it perks with volume could be a swing. I'm actually

**[05:13]** bored here on this thing here but didn't have any follow true so I took actually

**[05:19]** pretty decent loss on it. Not that I had an enormous amount of size or anything but I had too much

**[05:25]** size in relation to the volume so I had huge slippage here. I think you know I had an

**[05:31]** only made in stop loss at 950. I think I got filled up like low 9 or something and it was just

**[05:38]** ridiculous. So stupid. I think I'd like 4,000 shares and this thing you know I wanted to do more

**[05:47]** but you know it's very thin stock traded like it's like 100 to 100,000 shares on average.

**[05:53]** Many days only 50,000 shares so this one looks pretty good and again 50 days has almost

**[06:02]** scored up with the price. You know me go. This is another recent IPO. It's flagging here high

**[06:09]** lows in the 60 minute. Me go 50, the 50 days catching up blue. If it breaks out maybe a good setup.

**[06:20]** No no. Yeah again maybe. So I know this one actually I'm gonna set on a little bit of this one

**[06:27]** PMD super super thin stock. Actually I'm gonna remove it later. This is too thin for me.

**[06:37]** Golf recent IPO. It breaks this range share volume could have some follow through.

**[06:47]** Coup another bottoming recent IPO had a big big move here. I've been traded. I should have

**[06:54]** I saw this break out. So you can see I had a little arrow here just for putting it here for

**[07:00]** tracking purposes and you know that's a really good follow through. CRK still goes sideways.

**[07:06]** Another recent IPO. This is a biotech that's actually holding up very well. Biotechs have been

**[07:15]** very very weak to past couple of weeks and this is one of the few that's holding up. So you know

**[07:24]** it's a biotech stock going down or start going sideways or even start going up this thing and

**[07:29]** have a big big move. 50 days almost caught up with the price and this is actually exactly what I

**[07:35]** want to see this kind of setups. Again all you got is name probably needs more time. Another one

**[07:43]** is interesting on a 50 day. You know these things are not gonna do anything unless this oil names

**[07:50]** as a whole group break out. As you can see this one broke down out of this range today but this one

**[07:54]** is holding up. To do cheap row. No I don't know. If it has huge volume on a break out I may do it

**[08:06]** again just tracking this one.

**[08:13]** Another shinkler. P&R again. Oil name just needs to break out with a group. CRC does not look good.

**[08:23]** WTI. I'd feel a bit extended I'll remove it. I'll just see why. I just gonna set a alert for

**[08:32]** a range break here. I need to look at it every day. Let's see some shorts. This one I was thinking

**[08:40]** about training on the Monday but it's just a little bit on the theme side. I really wanted that

**[08:46]** 556 push but it didn't materialize. So I'm gonna trade here. What has some short article? You know this

**[08:56]** is a very disputed stock. Some people are usually bullish. Some people are usually bearish.

**[09:02]** I lean on the bearish side. I think there's too much height. There's like 99% probability. It's not

**[09:11]** gonna be in the next iPhone. Just all evidence points against it. But it's holding up. A lot of retail

**[09:20]** people they just refuse to. See the facts. But yeah I don't know when the next iPhone announcement

**[09:34]** is but it may be a great great short when that happens. Or yet I'm just tracking. I had a huge move.

**[09:44]** Looks has a little bit of a range here in the 60 minute. It breaks down here. You could have a

**[09:50]** couple of dollars downside. This is more of a swing try. A trade kind of short. I'm just tracking it.

**[09:57]** If it looks great on the internet short, I may do it. But if it like shows relative weakness or

**[10:05]** something, that's always a good sign. But so far, past six months it's only been showing relative

**[10:12]** strength. I had a good short. Damn this. So much taste. Let's see. Where is it? Here it is. I had a good

**[10:21]** short. When it broke below this range here, I'm very good short. I went down like 25% in up

**[10:28]** three, four or five days. So I'm thinking you know sensing may happen here. It's not gonna go up

**[10:36]** for all eternity. You know, it's this going to pull back. But it's still a little bit dangerous.

**[10:44]** I think long term, I think this thing has more upside. Fundamentally, they have some good stock

**[10:50]** going. Or them. So I wouldn't be surprised to see this thing go up another 10, 20 bucks, 30 bucks

**[10:58]** whatever. But short term, I think this may pull back to at least a 50 day or something. In video,

**[11:04]** this is, I was actually shorted for a couple of weeks. I shorted in here. I'm opening range

**[11:10]** lows or actually not open. Yeah, opening range lows in this day. Shorted somewhere here. I had a

**[11:15]** really good short on it. And I actually covered it yesterday because it's you know, just going

**[11:24]** sideways since. So I'm gonna remove this one. Test law. I'm tracking it. Hopefully it goes to about

**[11:32]** 26. There's something. But you know, this is straight up. Yeah, it's gonna pull back eventually.

**[11:37]** Like same thing in February, March, Wednesday, up. I had some really good short. So I mean, that was

**[11:42]** early a couple of times. So I took a you know, some losses on the way up. But then

**[11:48]** it's been one day finally started actually starting going down. So that was great. So I'm looking

**[11:54]** for something similar here. Maybe a couple more days upside and then a pull back by the 20 day,

**[11:59]** the yellow line here. I had a fine. I close kind of week. I'll watch this one. See you next again.

**[12:07]** I lost on it Friday. I did not trade in Monday. I was thinking about it. But it just,

**[12:13]** nah, just when SID was in a range, it was nothing there. But now starting to look really interesting.

**[12:22]** You know, I prefer it goes to like 15 or something today. But we'll see. I'm gonna look at something

**[12:30]** like opening range lows or green to red or lower highs or late day fades. Something like that.

**[12:40]** I'm not gonna short-drandly mean to strength. I want to see some kind of weakness first. They'll

**[12:46]** also need to go up another day. It's probably not ready yet. They starting to get a

**[12:52]** big stand. Then you know, huge move from the lows here. It's just going higher, higher, higher.

**[12:58]** It will have a snapback eventually. Especially going close to like 11, 11, 50 or 12 or something

**[13:05]** like that. You will have a snapback. Shane, I've been very sure of this thing for a few days.

**[13:12]** It trades on gold. So if gold goes down, that thing will go down. Gold is a little bit extended.

**[13:23]** So Shane, it looks like a great breakout chart from this little flag formation. But this thing

**[13:31]** doesn't trade like a stock. So I don't know. I'd rather short it. I'm not gonna pick any tops on it.

**[13:42]** I'm not gonna trade them alongside. This thing is programmed to go to zero. This is all

**[13:46]** this trip lead. As you can see, there's like reverse blade, reverse blade because you know, it just

**[13:52]** keeps going down, down, down. This thing was 200 bucks. And you know, once it gets down like

**[14:01]** some file or something like that, they're gonna do reverse blade again. She'll be us. Now this is

**[14:09]** an interesting one. They're trying to do an offering, but it's not going through for some reason.

**[14:14]** I don't know the details, but basically, a lot of people have been shorting it the past week

**[14:20]** because there's an offering coming. They're trying to do an offering. So they're gonna get a bad

**[14:28]** bad price on it because you know, they really don't demand for the offering. The ones wants to buy

**[14:34]** this piece of shit, even though that is discounted. So I've actually couple of trades in it, in this one.

**[14:43]** One is on the long side. As you can see, this 12 area has been, now everybody has been rejected. So

**[14:54]** if it starts breaking, this will involve you, especially later in the day. Let's say it goes sideways

**[15:01]** whole day on Tuesday, starts breaking up on high volume. And this thing haven't been running to

**[15:06]** the close. Nothing I would hold overnight. And it could also be a short day. I'll see about it.

**[15:16]** Had a 300% move from the low. So it's both a long and a short.

**[15:23]** The short I would hold overnight, especially if the close is very weak. That's something I would

**[15:30]** hold overnight. And again, this is really starting to set up nicely. The story here is basically,

**[15:38]** as you can see, this thing was a 22 bucks back in 2011.

**[15:47]** And now, then it got down to 25 cents, actually 20 cents, and now we set,

**[15:54]** actually it was at 360, 358, 7, in half the hour, some long days. So this thing can keep going.

**[16:04]** Okay. There's something I've learned from shorting momentum stocks is don't be too early.

**[16:12]** This thing needs to go, I think this thing can go to 4 or 5 bucks in a straight line.

**[16:18]** So the short here, I'm probably not going to short it on a while today.

**[16:34]** So, the idea to know I would be if it goes up all day, close is strong, and then has

**[16:41]** some more follow through on Wednesday. That would be something that I will be very interested in.

**[16:48]** But right now, just tracking it, I made it small size because I'm always affected by a fair

**[17:01]** missing out. So I'll try to do it like 10 to my normal size or something, or 20 percent to my normal size,

**[17:10]** just to be in it, just to feel like if it goes down without going to 4 or 5 bucks first,

**[17:17]** still participate a little bit. But again, if it goes like 5 or something, I'll be investing

**[17:25]** huge size. If it goes up today and then on Wednesday, I have no problem shorting 50 or

**[17:33]** 100 dollars a share with this thing. Try to catch like a 50 cent move on the downside or something

**[17:39]** like that or even a dollar move on the downside. Actually, if it goes like 4 or 5, probably.

**[17:46]** The move that will probably be a dollar in a day or two. But we'll see, this is something

**[17:51]** again set up and be a huge trade. OWCP had a big run, made it, and now it's been

**[18:05]** bouncy for two days. I'm thinking if this thing can go green the red,

**[18:09]** it may fade back to some 50 cents or something like that.

**[18:17]** In that case, this will be a dead cat bounce. But it can also keep going. But again, I'm looking for

**[18:23]** weakness, strong open and then just fizzle off. That's something I would be interested in. MIHI.

**[18:31]** I really want 120's, 130's first. It really needs to go up another day, I think.

**[18:38]** I probably won't look at it today. Let's go through some.

**[18:46]** Oh, whatever. I was going to tell the story about the NAK. So they're sitting on huge

**[18:52]** gold reserves in Alaska. What happened this, the Obama administration, they were very environmentally

**[19:02]** protective. So these guys couldn't, they didn't get the mining permits for their reserves.

**[19:11]** So it's been just been going down, down, down. They've just been bleeding cash and whatnot.

**[19:16]** And now, since Trump got elected, Trump doesn't give the government an environment. So the market

**[19:24]** is really anticipating that they may get the permits to get their gold and silver out,

**[19:32]** because they're really sitting on huge reserves. And if they get those permits through,

**[19:37]** I mean, this thing can go back to 10, 15, 20 bucks. But again, on short terms,

**[19:44]** very standard. This thing will pull back. It probably needs to go up a couple more bucks.

**[19:49]** Again, I'm really excited about this one, because it can be a really big trade,

**[19:55]** if it says it's upright. So you don't get these ones very often. Just

**[20:01]** that is really quick too. Even though it's low price, you can do a lot of size. So that's

**[20:06]** not very interested in. Now I'm just repeating myself, sorry for that. Now,

**[20:14]** let's look at another watch list.

**[20:22]** You know what I do is I usually track when when stocks break out to break down,

**[20:27]** especially if there's news on them, I usually track them. If I don't trade them,

**[20:31]** most of the time I don't trade them. But it's fun to track them and look back a couple of

**[20:36]** weeks or even a couple of months later and see what they did. You know, this is another bottom

**[20:41]** bio, had some volume broke. GSV Gold named really good break out here.

**[20:47]** Decent volume ads, it's still kind of thin name, low price, but you know,

**[20:51]** relatively close high volume. Good go. Especially gold keeps going and very easy to go with

**[20:55]** three bucks. EZO or a Y had some news. Amazon is starting to

**[21:03]** take their business. So they all broke down. So let's see if they keep going down. Maybe a

**[21:13]** shy home builder had a nice little volume break out here. Father, NTS, Momo, old Chinese stocks,

**[21:23]** nice high volume breakouts. This Momo I almost bought it, but I don't know, I hesitated and then

**[21:29]** it went higher and I didn't want to chase it. But it looks really good. You have a tight,

**[21:34]** tight flag, recent momentum name, no distinct, nice moves. You can very easily go back to 26,

**[21:40]** 27 bucks. NTS, recent IPO, it doesn't really look that good here. You know, here it had a break

**[21:50]** out from the bottom in range, had a big move, 30%. Let's see, maybe it goes.

**[21:57]** Google looks great at earnings later this week, but can go to like 860, 870s, maybe not 870s,

**[22:04]** but 860s is very possible before that. OLED, a high volume range break here. I usually want to

**[22:12]** see tightness before the break out day. You know, something like this, you know, a couple of tight

**[22:18]** candles before the break out. But it has some decent volumes on tracking it anyways. CMRX and

**[22:27]** other one, bottom biotech can go to like 6657. You hold, this was nice, flag, tight, tight

**[22:37]** for solidation and the brilliantly high volume break out. It's a very thin start, but it's high

**[22:44]** priced, so the dollar volume is actually pretty decent at. NTS, recent IPO, didn't really have any

**[22:51]** volume, but it bounced on the 50 day, you know, long, smooth, nice, clean up trend. This is exactly

**[22:59]** what I want to see on the long setups. And then a bounce off the, of moving average is like 20,

**[23:07]** 50 or the ones that I usually trade. This is the bottom stock as big volume. What I understand

**[23:16]** from the news, this is pretty much cap tier at 435, 440. What we'll see, AP also,

**[23:26]** at Amazon News, got down. VIAV, nice breakout, huge volume, 7 million shares. This is something

**[23:36]** I'm going to do a lot of size, but I didn't see it in my scans, I maybe wouldn't bought it.

**[23:43]** Here in the high AD, these 870, say 80s, but I didn't see it for some reason. I tube,

**[23:50]** Latin American bank, Latin American stocks have been pre-stronged the best couple of weeks.

**[23:55]** Many of them have been straight up. So it's a little bit extended, but yeah, it looks okay.

**[24:04]** Just tracking it. This is something I'm thinking about buying on Tuesday, another weed stock.

**[24:11]** These things can really be made, baby moves. Max, now this is probably running on the Trump

**[24:19]** policy thingy, or not the policy, but they're thinking about moving their US embassy in Israel

**[24:26]** from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, and this is an Israeli security name. So it's probably being pumped on that.

**[24:37]** Didn't have a huge volume, relatively tiny big volume, but relative to its float in town,

**[24:44]** I would have preferred to see a couple of million shares traded. This thing can go. This thing can

**[24:52]** have made big moves in the past. Coped me a few years ago. This thing can go to like a 10 box,

**[25:05]** but again, it still trades a little bit, so probably not going to look at it. Maybe it's set

**[25:12]** up in a few weeks or so, but this is, you know, it could really go. This is the kind of stock that

**[25:18]** these chat rooms and stuff. They love to pump these, you know, when they have a catalyst,

**[25:24]** like that macro, macro catalyst. You know, it can really go. Beard,

**[25:31]** a little bit of breakout here. High volume, nice. Just keeping track of it. Looking

**[25:41]** up a back in a few weeks from now and see what it did. Giga, very thin name, very thin name,

**[25:47]** but it's a beaten down bottom micro cap name and can go to one 50 or something.

**[25:54]** Mankind, another one. I was thinking about buying it. It's this thing as a history of huge runs. Like I

**[26:02]** said in the last video, I think I made it on Friday or during the weekend.

**[26:12]** This thing can go 100%. If it goes, it's made it in a five-minute time again, but really didn't have

**[26:20]** the volume I was looking for. So I didn't buy it. Excel, you know, another five-minute

**[26:25]** telling up very, very well. This five-minute thing, you know, maybe a week, most of them have broken

**[26:31]** down, but this is holding like a shab. You know, I would prefer more sideways action. It's not

**[26:38]** really ready yet. Chewie had a great, great breakout. Short term, a bit extended. I was thinking

**[26:44]** about buying it, but it feels a bit extended. This kind of a fight,

**[26:50]** fighting would have been nicer here, but now it's a feels-pipped extended. Okay, that's it. So

**[27:00]** the video is a little bit longer than I thought it would be. So I'm gonna try to keep it shorter

**[27:05]** next time, but I'm new to this YouTube video making thing so bear with me. Okay, good luck.

**[27:14]** On Tuesday. Oh, by the way, I forgot about this one. Actually, I forgot to do this recap thing.

**[27:28]** If you follow me on Twitter, you know I've been on this one since Thursday or Friday on

**[27:34]** the short side. I traded it on Monday. No, Friday, I did really good trade on it, and I traded it

**[27:41]** again on Monday. I had another really good trade on it. I traded the opening range lows just

**[27:49]** before it went red. This one only is three trades like Dave, B and R. I actually forwarded on Friday

**[27:58]** in another account. This day I saw some volume coming in, and it's basically bottomed out.

**[28:06]** Higher lows. This is 60 minutes short. As you can see, this made a huge move up to the month back.

**[28:13]** I'm not through, so I bought some more in the account I showed you. I bought it here in the

**[28:20]** sixth sense, tiny size since I was already in Longtees and size from Friday. I came back in,

**[28:26]** I saw this front loss. I really didn't want to see a weak lows like this. And I also traded

**[28:33]** GLBS on the long side because let's look at the 5 minute short. I had some volume coming in late

**[28:38]** day. I was actually not like to run on it, but then I started going back down. I'm like, okay,

**[28:44]** I'm not going to hold it overnight anyway, so I'll just sell it.

**[28:52]** Okay, that's it.
